## Introduction

This project aims to predict global temperature trends using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical temperature data and developing predictive models, we seek to enhance our understanding of climate dynamics and improve the accuracy of temperature forecasts.

## Objectives

- Analyze historical temperature data to identify trends and patterns.
- Develop machine learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for temperature prediction.
- Evaluate the performance of the predictive models using appropriate metrics.
</br>

## Expected Outcome

- Gain insights into global temperature dynamics and their drivers.
- Provide accurate temperature forecasts for future time periods.
- Contribute to climate research and decision-making processes with actionable insights.
</br>

## Results

- Trained LSTM models achieved promising results in forecasting global temperature trends.
- Evaluation metrics, including Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), demonstrated the models' predictive accuracy.
- Visualization of predicted temperature trends compared to actual observations provided valuable insights into climate patterns.
